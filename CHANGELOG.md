# 2.0.0 (2016-11-10)
**The whole project has been cleaned up and rewritten to adapt the codebase of the [Nord Atom UI](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-atom-ui) project!**
*This closes the milestone [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem-light-atom-ui/milestone/1) and the associated backlog ticket #3.*

## Features
Detailed information about new features can be found in the [README](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem-light-atom-ui/blob/develop/README.md#features) and the [Nord Atom UI](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-atom-ui#features) documentation!

### Color Palette
This major update has been migrated to the new Northem Light color palette version [`2.0.0`](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/northem-light/releases/tag/v2.0.0). (@arcticicestudio, #4, de7e30fb)

### Design
The old design was uncomfortable, unconsistent and has not been updated to the latest Atom version which resulted in unpredictable bugs and glitch due to changes of the Atom Core.
Northem Light Atom UI has adapted the Nord Atom UI design which provides a clean, elegant and up-to-date UI. (@arcticicestudio, #4, de7e30fb)
